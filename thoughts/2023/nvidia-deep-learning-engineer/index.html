Problem-solving</h3> <p><strong>Question:</strong> ‚ÄúDescribe a situation where you faced a challenging problem, and how you resolved it.‚Äù<br> <strong>Answer:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <em>Situation:</em> ‚ÄúWhile working on a fraud detection project, I encountered an issue with the model‚Äôs performance, which wasn‚Äôt meeting the desired accuracy threshold.‚Äù</li> <li> <em>Task:</em> ‚ÄúMy goal was to identify the root cause of the problem and improve the model‚Äôs accuracy.‚Äù</li> <li> <em>Action:</em> ‚ÄúI started by analyzing the dataset, verifying the preprocessing steps, and reviewing the model architecture. I discovered that the dataset was imbalanced, causing the model to be biased towards the majority class. I implemented a combination of under-sampling, over-sampling, and adjusting class weights to address the issue.‚Äù</li> <li> <em>Result:</em> ‚ÄúAfter applying these changes, the model‚Äôs accuracy significantly improved, and it successfully detected fraud cases with higher precision and recall.‚Äù</li> </ul> <h3 id="d-time-management">d. Time Management</h3> <p><strong>Question:</strong> ‚ÄúHow do you prioritize tasks when faced with multiple deadlines?‚Äù<br> <strong>Answer:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <em>Situation:</em> ‚ÄúIn my previous job, there were times when I had to manage multiple projects with overlapping deadlines.‚Äù</li> <li> <em>Task:</em> ‚ÄúMy objective was to efficiently allocate my time and resources to ensure all projects were completed on schedule.‚Äù</li> <li> <em>Action:</em> ‚ÄúI used a combination of time management techniques, such as creating a prioritized to-do list, breaking tasks into smaller milestones, and setting realistic deadlines. I also communicated my workload to my team and manager to ensure transparency and to seek help when needed.‚Äù</li> <li> <em>Result:</em> ‚ÄúBy effectively prioritizing and managing my time, I was able to complete all projects on schedule while maintaining a high level of quality.‚Äù</li> </ul> <h3 id="e-adaptability">e. Adaptability</h3> <p><strong>Question:</strong> ‚ÄúTell me about a time when you had to adapt to a significant change at work.‚Äù<br> <strong>Answer:</strong></p> <ul> <li> <em>Situation:</em> ‚ÄúAt my previous job, our team had to switch from using TensorFlow to PyTorch for a new project, while still maintaining our existing TensorFlow-based projects.‚Äù</li> <li> <em>Task:</em> ‚ÄúMy goal was to quickly adapt to the new framework and ensure a smooth transition for the team.‚Äù</li> <li> <em>Action:</em> ‚ÄúI proactively took online courses and read documentation to familiarize myself with PyTorch. I also participated in code reviews and discussions with colleagues experienced in PyTorch to gain practical insights. To facilitate the team‚Äôs transition, I created a guide highlighting the key differences between the two frameworks and conducted training sessions to share my knowledge.‚Äù</li> <li> <em>Result:</em> ‚ÄúAs a result, the team was able to adapt to the new framework more quickly and efficiently. We successfully developed and maintained projects in both TensorFlow and PyTorch, demonstrating our adaptability and ability to embrace new technologies.‚Äù</li> </ul> <h2 id="10-company-specific-knowledge">10.
