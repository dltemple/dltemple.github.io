### b. Activation Functions

**Let's dive** into the _enticing complexity_ of activation functions, shall we? These functions inject a dose of
non-linearity into the network, endowing it with the remarkable ability to learn those ever-so-intricate patterns. At
NVIDIA, you'll find yourself mingling with some of the most _captivating_ activation functions:

- **Sigmoid**: A smooth character, elegantly mapping input values to a delightful range between 0 and 1.
- **Hyperbolic tangent (tanh)**: The suave sibling of Sigmoid, taking things up a notch by mapping inputs to a range
  from -1 to 1.
- **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)**: The no-nonsense, straight-to-the-point operator, keeping things positive by setting
  negative inputs to zero.
- **Leaky ReLU**: ReLU's slightly mischievous cousin, allowing a tiny bit of negative input to slip through with a
  small, non-zero slope.
- **Softmax**: The charming diplomat, gracefully converting raw scores into probabilities that sum up to 1, perfect for
  multi-class classification problems.
- **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)**: The adventurous type, bringing exponential dynamics to the table, aiming to
  mitigate the vanishing gradient problem.

- Cloud: Cloud-based deployment involves deploying your deep learning models on remote servers managed by a cloud
  service provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure). This approach allows for easy scalability, reduced
  infrastructure costs, and faster deployment. Cloud deployment often uses containerization technologies like Docker and
  orchestration tools like Kubernetes for managing and scaling services.

- On-premises: On-premises deployment involves deploying models on local servers or data centers within the
  organization's infrastructure. This approach provides better control over data security and compliance but may require
  significant upfront investment in hardware and maintenance.

### b. Model Optimization Techniques

- Quantization: Quantization is the process of reducing the numerical precision of model weights and activations,
  usually from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats like 16-bit or 8-bit integers. This reduces
  model size and speeds up computation while maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy.

- Pruning: Pruning involves removing less important connections or neurons in a neural network, thereby reducing the
  number of parameters and computational complexity. Various pruning techniques exist, including weight pruning, neuron
  pruning, and structured pruning (e.g., pruning entire filters in CNNs).

- Distillation: Knowledge distillation is a technique where a smaller, more efficient student model is trained to mimic
  the behavior of a larger, more accurate teacher model. The student model learns from the teacher model's output,
  usually through a softened version of the teacher model's logits, which helps the student model generalize better and
  achieve higher accuracy.

  parameters for optimal performance.

- Dynamic Tensor Memory: TensorRT optimizes memory usage during inference by reusing memory allocated for intermediate
  tensors.

- Precision Calibration: TensorRT supports mixed-precision optimization, allowing you to use lower-precision data
  types (e.g., FP16, INT8) while maintaining model accuracy through calibration. This reduces memory usage and speeds up
  inference.
