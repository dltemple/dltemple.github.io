    abstract = {Applications of artificial intelligence have been gaining extraordinary traction in recent years across innumerable
                domains. These novel approaches and technological leaps permit leveraging profound quantities of data in a manner from which to
                elucidate and ease the modeling of arduous physical phenomena. ExoAnalytic collects over 500,000 resident space object images
                nightly with an arsenal of over 300 autonomous sensors; extending the autonomy of collection to data curation, anomaly detection, and
                notification is of paramount improtance if elusive events are desired to be captured and classified.
                Efforts begin with rigorous image annotation of observed glints, streaking stars, and resident space obejcts; synthetic plumes were generated
                from both Generative Adversarial Networks as well as manual image augmentation techniques. Preliminary results permitted the successful classification
                of observed debris generated events from AMC-9, Telkom-1, and Intelsat-29e. After initial proof-of-concept, these events are
                incorporated into the training pipeline in order to characterize potentially unknown debris generating or anomalous events
                in future observations. The inclusion of a visual tracking system aides in reducing false alarms by roughly 30%.
                Future efforts include applications on both historical datamining as well as real-time indications and warnings for satellite analysts in
                their daily operations while maintaining a low probability of false alarm through detection and tracking algorithm refinement.},
