## _I’d love to say there’s something uniquely special about me in my about me, but I’m not a liar._

#### **Some personal tenants:**

-	Using eclectic experience to discover novel solutions
-	Striving to identify the role model in the room and emulate them
-	Not being complacent in anything I do

#### **Things that get me excited:**
-	Deep-learning and optimization
-	Physics, simulations, and modeling
-	Abstracting small ideas to a large-scale and seeing the weak points
-	Creative outlets: astrophotography, media creation, furniture building
-	Exercise: running, cycling, powerlifting
-	DIY home improvement
-	Ergogenics and human performance optimization
-	Sometimes playing guitar and needing to play saxophone more
-	Anything outdoors that requires some grittiness


If you caught me on any one day, I’d most likely be reading [r/FatFire](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/), programming machine learning algorithms, running or lifting weights, walking my dog, listening to an off-beat podcast, or finding something niche over which to obsess.

I’m not the fastest runner, nor the most proficient machine learning engineer I’ve ever met. I’m not breaking any records. My astrophotography shots aren’t published. I don’t have thousands of citations and I most certainly don’t have prestigious degrees. I won’t blow you away with anything about me.

However

I have my hands and my heart in a lot of distinct areas.
With that comes imposter-like feelings in nearly everything I do, but one thing that can’t be faked is my fervency, honesty, and stick-to-it-iveness.
