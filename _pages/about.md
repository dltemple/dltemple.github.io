## _I’d love to say there’s something uniquely special about me in my about me, but I’m not a liar._

### **Personal Tenets:**
- Leveraging diverse experiences to craft innovative solutions
- Continuously seeking role models and learning from them
- Challenging complacency in all aspects of life

### **Passions & Interests:**
- Deep learning and optimization
- Physics, simulations, and modeling
- Scaling ideas and identifying weak points
- Creative pursuits: astrophotography, media creation, furniture building
- Fitness: running, cycling, powerlifting
- DIY home improvement
- Ergogenics and human performance optimization
- Musical exploration: playing guitar and aspiring to play saxophone more
- Outdoor adventures that demand resilience and determination


If you caught me on any one day, I’d most likely be reading [r/FatFire](https://www.reddit.com/r/fatFIRE/), programming machine learning algorithms, running or lifting weights, walking my dog, listening to an off-beat podcast, or finding something niche over which to obsess.

I’m not the fastest runner, nor the most proficient machine learning engineer I’ve ever met. I’m not breaking any records. My astrophotography shots aren’t published. I don’t have thousands of citations and I most certainly don’t have prestigious degrees. I won’t blow you away with anything about me.

However

I have my hands and my heart in a lot of distinct areas.
With that comes imposter-like feelings in nearly everything I do, but one thing that can’t be faked is my fervency, honesty, and stick-to-it-iveness.
